### Join Us!
Any state, county (in county-administered systems), or private agency is welcome to join us. We also welcome input from any individuals or organizations with expertise and best practices to share!

To join, email marina AT marinanitze DOT com.

There is absolutely no cost to participate, and the commitment is just two hours a month.

In exchange for participating, you will gain:
* Best practices for improving your own processes, in an actionable format (e.g. sample contracts, checklists, policy language, etc.)
* Data about how your current practices compare with other states (shared in a private, respectful manner - no shaming/ranking)
* Opportunities to participate in cross-state improvement projects
* Positive media coverage related to your participation (always cleared/approved by you ahead of time)
* Implementation assistance for adapting best practices to your area

How the cohort works:
* Every month, we focus on a specific topic area (e.g. home inspections, foster parent training, increasing kin licensing). 
We will schedule a one-hour "interview" with your subject matter expert(s) for the topic to gather information.
* Everyone joins a one-hour webinar where we share key findings and best practices from existing pilots and national experts, and suggest cross-state projects.
* You will receive a personalized follow-up with recommendations for your specific processes.
* Optionally, we can also hold a 1:1 follow-up call to go over more in-depth recommendations for your team, and to provide any implementation help you may need.
* Best practices and positive results will be captured here in the online Foster Care Playbook, including actionable collateral like example checklists and contracts.
