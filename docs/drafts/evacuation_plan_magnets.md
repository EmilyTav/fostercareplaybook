### The Play

A dry-erase magnet for foster families to document practicing their evacuation plans.

**Who Can Do This?:**
Direct line workers

**Cost:**
Free

**Timeframe:**
Immediate

**Difficulty:**
Easy

### The Problem It Solves

Many families forget to complete their required fire evacuation practice throughout the year, and don't have this information available at license renewal. The magnet reminds families to practice, and serves as easy documentation that they did so.

### How To Do This

Use this template ([DOCX](/assets/Emergency%20Fridge%20Decoration.docx) or [PDF](/assets/Emergency%20Fridge%20Decoration.pdf)) to make your own magnets. If you modify this template, we'd love for you to share yours too!
