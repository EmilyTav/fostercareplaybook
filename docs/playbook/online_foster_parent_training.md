### The Play

Switch to Web-based training and online/telephone recruitment and orientation events, so you don't have to stop licensing families. You can use existing resources from places like Washington State, Washington DC, and Michigan that are already doing this.

**Who Can Do This?:**
A licensing decision maker<br />
**Cost:**
Free<br />
**Timeframe:**
About a week<br />
**Difficulty:**
Easier if you use existing resources<br />

### The Problem It Solves

Many agencies are pausing their resource family training and licensing efforts. As the need for safe homes for our foster children swells, we can't afford to wait months to license these families.

### How To Do This

**Existing online foster parent training:** [Caregiver Core Training (CCT)](https://allianceforchildwelfare.org/project/learn-more-about-caregiver-core-training-online) is the online system developed by the Alliance for Child Welfare Excellence, a partnership within Washington State.  If you are interested in discussing with the Alliance whether this is a viable option for your state, please contact them directly.

* See their [overview slide deck](/assets/CCT_Online_Intro.pdf)
* Contact Christina Coad (ccoad AT uw DOT edu) for more information. 

**For telephone orientations:** Use this slide deck ( [PPT](/assets/CFSA_Recruitment_Orientation_March_2020_Pride.pptx) / [PDF](/assets/CFSA_Recruitment_Orientation_March_2020_Pride.pdf) ) prepared by Washington DC's Child and Family Services Agency Recruitment and Family Licensing Units.

* DC provided a PowerPoint for participants to follow along and had a foster parent on the phone line to provide a real-world perspective of the foster care experience. 

* The training was well-received. Participants had many questions and the foster parent got the most questions.

**For converting your own in-training to online training:** Michigan has recommended best practices:

* Creating closed Facebook groups for each class help class members to form connections with each other and allow trainers to send out videos, homework, etc. These groups create connections between participants and allow for a support group of sorts. 

* Parents prefer scheduling classes more frequently, which allows for parents to switch out between spending time with children and attending the training in two-parent households. 

* While Michigan used to offer full-day in-person classes during weekends, day-long online classes are way too long to do on the computer. Online sessions are scheduled one session at a time. 

* Many learners had not done web meetings before. In response, Michigan created web meeting guidelines to send to each participant prior to the first class meeting. These guidelines included general expectations, web meeting manners (i.e. how to dress appropriately, when to mute), and instructions on how to use the technology. They also created questionnaires for each session to make sure that parents are understanding the material as the trainer covers it. 

* Michigan found it helpful to leave time at the beginning of the meeting to assist with any technical difficulties. 

* Having a backup person in the agency who is good at technology and can provide real-time technical assistance during the class meeting is extremely helpful. 

* Cap the session at approximately 20 people -- if it is too big, it is too hard to engage everyone. 

* The in-person training has lots of hands-on activities that can’t easily be done remotely. Instead, Michigan has cut those activities and instead stops to discuss the material more often. 

* Build in short breaks throughout the session so that people don’t disengage. 

* Jessica Sweet from MI DHHS has generously offered her assistance if you have any questions. You can reach her at SweetJ2 AT michigan DOT gov.
